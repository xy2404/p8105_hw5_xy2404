---------

### Create a tidy dataframe

``` r
long_study <- list.files('/Users/annie/Desktop/data science/Homework/homework5/Homework 5/data')  

df_longstudy <- function(x){
   read_df<- read_csv(paste0('/Users/annie/Desktop/data science/Homework/homework5/Homework 5/data/', x))
   read_df
}

output= map(long_study, df_longstudy)
```

read_df<-long_study %>%

df<-as.data.frame(read_df) 

longstudy<-

  gather(key = week, value = value, week_1:week_8) %>% 
  mutate(week = str_replace(week, 'week_', '')) %>% 
  mutate(week = as.numeric(week)) %>% 
  separate(read_df, into = c("arms", "id"),sep = "_") 
```

### Make a spaghetti plot showing observations on each subject over time, and comment on differences between groups.

``` r
ggplot(longstudy, aes(x= week, y = value, color=id))+
  facet_grid(~as.factor(arms))+
  geom_line()+
  labs(
    title = "The Difference Between Control Group and Experiment Gruop",
    x = "Weeks",
    y = "Value"
  )+
  viridis::scale_color_viridis(
    discrete = TRUE
  ) + 
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```
